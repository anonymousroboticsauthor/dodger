# G1 navigation policy bundle

This directory is self-contained so it can be copied to the robot without
depending on the training checkout.

- `exported/high_level_navigation_policy/gat_encoder.onnx`: dynamic
  `[batch, N, 8]` nodes to the 16D robot embedding. Nodes are ordered as
  robot, goal, then up to ten prioritized perception obstacles; there are no
  dummy nodes or valid masks.
- `exported/high_level_navigation_policy/policy_head.onnx`: 16D robot
  embedding plus the 13D local state to physical `[a_s, a_l, yaw_rate]`,
  10 Hz.
- `exported/low_level_locomotion_policy.onnx`: 98D locomotion observation to
  29 joint actions, 50 Hz.
- `params/navigation.yaml`: goal, watchdog and visualization settings.
- `params/low_level_deploy.yaml`: the low-level observation/action pipeline.

The eight node features are `[is_robot, is_obstacle, is_goal, relative_x,
relative_y, radius, relative_vx, relative_vy]` in the robot body frame. The
obstacle radius is the circle radius received from `/obstacles_safe`; the GAT
computes pairwise surface distances internally.

Navigation always waits for the first external `/navigation/goal`. After that
goal is reached in both position and heading, random follow-up goals are
generated only when `enable_random_goal: true` and `g1_ctrl` runs with
`--network=lo`. Hardware never generates random goals.

Console number-key FSM transitions remain enabled in simulation. On hardware,
set `console_fsm_control.simulation_only: false` in
`deploy/robots/g1/config/config.yaml` to opt in. A number key is accepted only
when its target is a configured transition from the current state.
