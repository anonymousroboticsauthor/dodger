# G1 hardware preflight — Phase 5C, stage 1. READ-ONLY.
#
# Run this on the machine that will run the perception stack, before ANY
# launch file, with the robot powered but not commanded. It starts no node,
# opens no LiDAR socket, publishes no topic and cannot move the robot: every
# check below is `ip`, `ping`, `test -f`, a checksum, or a python script that
# only reads files.

#   g1_hw_preflight.sh                 # full preflight
#   g1_hw_preflight.sh --lidar-ip X    # override the IP taken from the JSON
#   g1_hw_preflight.sh --quiet         # summary only
#
# Exit 0 = every hard gate passed. Exit 1 = at least one HARD FAIL: do not
# launch anything. Exit 2 = placeholder network configuration (the expected
# state on a dev machine, a hard stop on the robot).
#
# Every FAIL line names the stage of the first-experiment runbook it blocks,
# so a failure here maps directly onto "which paragraph do I go read".
